Your plan looks solid, George! Flower classification is a great choice for its simplicity and visual appeal. Here are some suggestions to help streamline your project:

### Dataset Suggestions
You can find labeled flower datasets that are readily usable:
1. **[Oxford 102 Flower Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/):**
   - Contains 102 flower categories with 8,189 images.
   - Well-labeled and popular for flower classification tasks.
   - Images are reasonably sized, making it easier to process.

2. **[Kaggle Flower Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets):**
   - Search for "flower classification" or "flower dataset."
   - Examples: Flower Recognition dataset (with common flower species).
   - Easy integration into notebooks for exploration.

3. **[TensorFlow Datasets (tfds)](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets):**
   - Pre-packaged datasets like `tf_flowers` are directly usable in TensorFlow.
   - Includes a mix of labeled flowers and is designed for quick prototyping.

### Steps to Simplify the Project
1. **Transfer Learning:**
   - Use a pretrained model like **MobileNetV2**, **ResNet50**, or **EfficientNet** (available in frameworks like TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch).
   - Fine-tune only the last few layers for your flower dataset to save time and computational resources.

2. **AWS Deployment:**
   - Package your model as a `.h5` (Keras) or `.pth` (PyTorch) file.
   - Use a Python Lambda function with libraries like `boto3` for file handling and `TensorFlow` or `TorchServe` for inference.

3. **Frontend:**
   - Use AWS S3 to host a simple webpage for uploading images.
   - Connect the webpage to API Gateway using a POST request to send the image to your Lambda function.

4. **Additional Tools:**
   - Use **AWS SageMaker** for training if you need extra computational resources or a pre-configured ML environment.
   - **AWS Lambda Layers** can help include libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch if they're not small enough to bundle with your Lambda function.

Would you like detailed guidance on implementing any of these steps, such as setting up the Lambda function, building the classification model, or preparing the dataset?

Your plan is solid and achievable within a short timeframe, especially with the use of transfer learning and AWS services like Lambda and API Gateway. Below are some suggestions to make the project easier and faster to deploy:

---

### 1. **Dataset for Flower Classification**
   - **Oxford 102 Flower Dataset**: This is a popular dataset for flower classification. It contains 102 categories of flowers, with each class having between 40 and 258 images. The dataset is well-labeled and widely used for transfer learning tasks.
     - Download: [Oxford 102 Flowers Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/)
   - **TensorFlow Datasets**: You can also use the TensorFlow Datasets library to easily load the Oxford 102 Flowers dataset.
     ```python
     import tensorflow_datasets as tfds
     dataset, info = tfds.load('oxford_flowers102', with_info=True, as_supervised=True)
     ```
   - **Kaggle**: Search for flower datasets on Kaggle. Many datasets are preprocessed and ready to use.
     - Example: [Flowers Recognition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition)

---

### 2. **Transfer Learning with a Pre-trained Model**
   - Use a pre-trained model like **MobileNetV2**, **ResNet50**, or **EfficientNet** from TensorFlow/Keras. These models are available in the `tensorflow.keras.applications` module and are pre-trained on ImageNet.
   - Example:
     ```python
     from tensorflow.keras.applications import MobileNetV2
     from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, GlobalAveragePooling2D
     from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

     base_model = MobileNetV2(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))
     base_model.trainable = False  # Freeze the base model

     x = base_model.output
     x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
     x = Dense(1024, activation='relu')(x)
     predictions = Dense(102, activation='softmax')(x)  # 102 classes for Oxford Flowers

     model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)
     model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
     ```

---

### 3. **Training the Model**
   - Use a GPU-enabled environment (e.g., AWS EC2 with a GPU instance, Google Colab, or your local machine with a GPU) to train the model.
   - Fine-tune the model on the flower dataset. Since the dataset is relatively small, training should be fast.
   - Example training code:
     ```python
     train_data, val_data = dataset['train'], dataset['validation']

     # Preprocess the data
     def preprocess(image, label):
         image = tf.image.resize(image, (224, 224))
         image = tf.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2.preprocess_input(image)
         return image, label

     train_data = train_data.map(preprocess).batch(32).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
     val_data = val_data.map(preprocess).batch(32).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)

     # Train the model
     history = model.fit(train_data, validation_data=val_data, epochs=10)
     ```

---

### 4. **Deploying the Model with AWS Lambda and API Gateway**
   - **Save the Model**: Save the trained model in TensorFlow SavedModel format.
     ```python
     model.save('flower_model')
     ```
   - **Package the Model**: Use the `tensorflow-serving` or `tensorflow-lite` runtime for Lambda. Alternatively, use a lightweight framework like **FastAPI** or **Flask** to serve the model.
   - **Lambda Function**:
     - Create a Lambda function that loads the model and processes incoming image requests.
     - Use API Gateway to expose the Lambda function as a REST API.
   - **Example Lambda Code**:
     ```python
     import json
     import tensorflow as tf
     from tensorflow.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2 import preprocess_input, decode_predictions
     import numpy as np
     from PIL import Image
     import io

     model = tf.keras.models.load_model('flower_model')

     def lambda_handler(event, context):
         # Load and preprocess the image
         image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(event['body']))
         image = image.resize((224, 224))
         image = np.array(image)
         image = preprocess_input(image)
         image = np.expand_dims(image, axis=0)

         # Predict
         predictions = model.predict(image)
         predicted_class = np.argmax(predictions, axis=1)

         return {
             'statusCode': 200,
             'body': json.dumps({'class': int(predicted_class[0])})
         }
     ```

---

### 5. **Frontend for Image Upload**
   - Create a simple HTML page with a file input and a button to upload the image.
   - Use JavaScript to send the image to the API Gateway endpoint.
   - Example:
     ```html
     <input type="file" id="imageUpload" accept="image/*">
     <button onclick="uploadImage()">Upload</button>
     <script>
       async function uploadImage() {
         const file = document.getElementById('imageUpload').files[0];
         const formData = new FormData();
         formData.append('file', file);

         const response = await fetch('YOUR_API_GATEWAY_URL', {
           method: 'POST',
           body: formData
         });

         const result = await response.json();
         console.log(result);
       }
     </script>
     ```

---

### 6. **Tips for Faster Deployment**
   - Use **SageMaker** for training and deployment if you want a fully managed AWS solution.
   - Use **Docker** to package your model and dependencies for Lambda.
   - Use **TensorFlow Lite** if you need a smaller model for faster inference.

---

### 7. **Alternative Dataset (If Flowers Are Too Complex)**
   If the Oxford 102 Flowers dataset feels too large or complex, consider using a simpler dataset like:
   - **MNIST** (handwritten digits)
   - **CIFAR-10** (10 classes of objects)
   - **Fashion MNIST** (clothing items)

These datasets are smaller and easier to work with for quick prototyping.
